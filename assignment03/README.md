### The Design Challenge
#### How might I design an easier, accessible music learning experience that empowers middle-aged men to learn at an older age?

To tackle this challenge, I must consider:
- **The main activity this project supports**
  - This project supports middle-aged men in their journey to learn how to play an instrument and to find and read music sheets they want to play. 
- **The basic need that is fulfilled**
  - Oftentimes, people feel that they wish they learned an instrument at a young age – whether that be the piano, violin, guitar, etc – but never did. This activity would help fulfill a user’s self-actualization needs as they pursue their goal of learning a new skill, specifically learning to play a new instrument, to realize their goals and full potential. 
- **The traditional and current solutions to satisfying these needs**
  - Traditional solutions to learning how to play an instrument include taking community recreational classes or private music lessons. These in-person solutions provide the aspect of live feedback and training but may be restricted in terms of the choice of music played.
  -  Other solutions include taking private lessons online or downloading music learning apps such as [Musescore](https://musescore.org), [Tomplay](https://tomplay.com), or [Flowkey](https://www.flowkey.com). These online alternatives often allow users to learn how to sight-read and play alongside audio playbacks.
-  **There are limitations that could be improved with technology**
    - Limitations with designing this project deal with the demographics of our target users. Middle-aged men may not be as familiar with using technology, so the complexity of current music apps must be made simpler for this target group.
    - With in-person lessons, people may not be able to select from a wide range of music. Depending on the instrument, scores may be restricted to classical music. I want to empower the user to personalize their music learning experience by learning the songs they want.
   - In current free music learning apps, most interactions are one-sided. Users may prefer to have live feedback from a real instructor within an app to improve their learning experience.
