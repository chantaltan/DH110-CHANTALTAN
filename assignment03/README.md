# **Making Music Learning Accessible**
## Assignment 03 - Contextual Inquiry

### The Design Challenge
#### How might I design an easier, accessible music learning experience that empowers middle-aged men to learn at an older age?

To tackle this challenge, I must consider:
- **The main activity this project supports**
  - This project supports middle-aged men in their journey to learn how to play an instrument and to find and read music sheets they want to play. 
- **The basic need that is fulfilled**
  - Oftentimes, people feel that they wish they learned an instrument at a young age – whether that be the piano, violin, guitar, etc – but never did. This activity would help fulfill a user’s self-actualization needs as they pursue their goal of learning a new skill, specifically learning to play a new instrument, to realize their goals and full potential. 
- **The traditional and current solutions to satisfying these needs**
  - Traditional solutions to learning how to play an instrument include taking community recreational classes or private music lessons. These in-person solutions provide the aspect of live feedback and training but may be restricted in terms of the choice of music played.
  -  Other solutions include taking private lessons online or downloading music learning apps such as [Musescore](https://musescore.org), [Tomplay](https://tomplay.com), or [Flowkey](https://www.flowkey.com). These online alternatives often allow users to learn how to sight-read and play alongside audio playbacks.
-  **There are limitations that could be improved with technology**
    - Limitations with designing this project deal with the demographics of our target users. Middle-aged men may not be as familiar with using technology, so the complexity of current music apps must be made simpler for this target group.
    - With in-person lessons, people may not be able to select from a wide range of music. Depending on the instrument, scores may be restricted to classical music. I want to empower the user to personalize their music learning experience by learning the songs they want.
   - In current free music learning apps, most interactions are one-sided. Users may prefer to have live feedback from a real instructor within an app to improve their learning experience.

### Defining the Target Users
**User characteristics**
- Demographics: Middle-aged men (ages 40-60)
- Preferences: Expertise in music and reading music sheets can be any level (even close to none). Users can be starting to learn how to play music from an older age or want to pick up learning again on their own time.
- Users might have a range of familiarity with using technology to complete the activity, but usually they may have experience learning how to play an instrument in-person with an instructor.

**Context of doing this activity**
- Users would want to play an instrument while learning on their own; they may like self-learning.
- Users would learn on their own time, in their own home, asynchronously as a hobby.

**How the users would go about completing this activity**
- To complete this activity in-person, users may have an instructor through group classes or private lessons to practice and learn songs. Music sheets may or may not be chosen by the instructor.
- To complete this activity online, users would go online and search for a music learning platform to start playing. Then, they would search for a song and instrument they would like to play to find the appropriate music sheets. Once they have found the music sheet to their liking, users can use a variety of settings to learn how to play it.


### Research Methods
I will conduct a contextual inquiry session, which will include an interview and overt participatory observation of the user. For the interview, I asked background questions about the user’s music learning background and in what contexts he learns to play his instrument and find music sheets. For the observation, I observed how the user would find music sheets online. Since he did not have his instrument with him, I was not able to observe how he would practice alongside the music sheets.

The session was conducted at the user’s own home over Zoom, where they might practice their instrument or use their device to find music online. The user did not feel comfortable sharing his video, so only his audio file will be shared.

### Reflection
From this contextual inquiry, I learned a lot about adjusting my conduct based on an individual user's experiences and responses to the questions. The user I interviewed shared insights based on the context of having played an instrument before. If I interviewed a user with no experience playing an instrument, I would have had to adjust the way I worded my questions and which questions to ask based on their expertise. Even in this contextual inquiry, I found myself asking follow-up questions on the fly or skipping questions that they had already answered. 

From this activity, I received some interesting insights, some of which I did not expect. For example, the user mentioned using the internet to find music sheets -- but not through a platform specific to music learning. Instead, they used Google images to find screenshots and related links for the music sheets they wanted. Also, since the target users may not be familiar with using technology to supplement their music learning, I have to consider how to design an app that provides the most simple functions necessary for learning. This may mean only making the metronome and key visible alongside the sheets while hiding more advanced features. Although this contextual inquiry provided rich insights, I would like to interview more people from my target user group who have varying music playing expertise.
