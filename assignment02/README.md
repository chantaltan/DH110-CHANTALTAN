# **Making Music Learning Accessible**
## Assignment 02 - Pilot Usability Testing
Chantal Tan | DH 110

### Introduction
Musescore is a music learning platform for users to find music sheets, practice alongside it, and learn from online courses. After conducting a heuristic analysis on the website, I found several usability problems. Most notably, they included:
- The website creates an overwhelming experience by displaying filters, music sheet information, music sheets, and courses all within the same screens. It is cluttered, and the information could be organized in a more minimalistic way.
- Musescore’s recommended courses are featured at the top of the screen while their music sheets are placed below those. This is not consistent with other music learning websites that place music sheets on its own page and online courses on another.
- When playing alongside the music sheets, some features that can be helpful are difficult to find or know what purpose they serve.

The purpose of this pilot usability testing is to find richer insights from a user himself, and to see if there can be any modifications regarding the design of my survey and conduct. 


### Methodology

The usability test will be conducted over Zoom. Both the moderator (me) and the participant will be in a quiet room. I will be using Zoom on my laptop to record the session.

I will ask the user to place the UT survey and the website as two separate windows side-by-side, with the website taking up about 75% of the screen. I will read the UT script and walk through the informed consent form before moving on to the tasks. The user will be asked to complete a series of tasks, which they will be asked to  provide verbal feedback while completing; along the way, they will also complete the form to indicate their success. The difficulty level, completion time, and likelihood of completing each task will also be collected. The last part of the survey will ask about their satisfaction with the website and demographic information.

The process was as follows:
- Introduction
- Background questions
- Pre-test questions
- Tasks
- Post-test questions
- Product satisfaction card
- Demographics

 
This test is meant to be a pilot usability test, using a participant who is close to the target user group of middle-aged men.

### Reflection

During the pilot test, the user completed the survey and tasks pretty smoothly. I was unable to find a user that matches the demographic needed - a middle-aged man, but I found a participant closest to that. In the final usability testing sessions, I will try to find middle-aged men that match my target user group. Because the user tested was younger and is more familiar with technology, the data would show that he completed all the tasks fairly easily. However, I may add more subtasks regarding filtering for certain music sheets and using Musescore’s play-along features across several music sheet pages.

From this pilot test, I received some initial insights as well. Although the user could complete all the tasks, there are some improvements that could be made to improve the satisfaction level when using the site. For example, the user noted that the online courses weren’t the main aspect that he would use; but, it was featured at the very top of the screen, taking up a substantial amount of space and seemed to be prioritized over the music sheets. I will put this into consideration when redesigning the website.

Additionally, I did not expect to have to moderate the portion where I had to explain how to set up the screen with the survey and website as two windows. The way the website is minimized also changes the way some features are displayed - such as the tempo feature. When the screen is maximized, the tempo feature appears as a slider with a metronome icon, but when the screen is minimized slightly, the tempo feature appears as input steppers with a stopwatch icon. In the future, I will make sure to include in my script the setup to ensure consistency in experience between users. Also, I will make sure the icons and components used in the design are consistent when the screen is adjusted.

Overall, I found that it is important to learn from the user and observe how they interact with the website being tested. Through these methods, I find that usability testing validates any issues I initially encountered through my heuristics analysis while also providing additional insights that can be improved on. Moving forward, I will ask more off-script follow-up questions related to their thoughts while moving through the site to receive richer insights.
