### Reflection
During the pilot test, the user completed the survey and tasks pretty smoothly. I was unable to find a user that matches the demographic needed - a middle-aged man, but I found a participant closest to that. In the final usability testing sessions, I will try to find middle-aged men that match my target user group. Because the user tested was younger and is more familiar with technology, the data would show that he completed all the tasks fairly easily. However, I may add more subtasks regarding filtering for certain music sheets and using Musescore’s play-along features across several music sheet pages.<br>From this pilot test, I received some initial insights as well. Although the user could complete all the tasks, there are some improvements that could be made to improve the satisfaction level when using the site. For example, the user noted that the online courses weren’t the main aspect that he would use; but, it was featured at the very top of the screen, taking up a substantial amount of space and seemed to be prioritized over the music sheets. I will put this into consideration when redesigning the website.<br>Additionally, I did not expect to have to moderate the portion where I had to explain how to set up the screen with the survey and website as two windows. The way the website is minimized also changes the way some features are displayed - such as the tempo feature. When the screen is maximized, the tempo feature appears as a slider with a metronome icon, but when the screen is minimized slightly, the tempo feature appears as input steppers with a stopwatch icon. In the future, I will make sure to include in my script the setup to ensure consistency in experience between users. Also, I will make sure the icons and components used in the design are consistent when the screen is adjusted.<br>Overall, I found that it is important to learn from the user and observe how they interact with the website being tested. Through these methods, I find that usability testing validates any issues I initially encountered through my heuristics analysis while also providing additional insights that can be improved on. Moving forward, I will ask more off-script follow-up questions related to their thoughts while moving through the site to receive richer insights.
