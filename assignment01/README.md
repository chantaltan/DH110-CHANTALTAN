# **Making Music Learning Accessible**
## Assignment 01 - Heuristic Analysis
Chantal Tan | DH 110

### About the project
Learning how to play a new instrument at an older age can be daunting and challenging. From learning how to sight-read, finding music sheets that are appropriate to play, and practicing alone, there are some key aspects a music learning platform must provide to create a smooth, accessible learning experience. I hope to explore how the process of browsing songs and practicing with music sheets online can be made more seamless for the target audience of middle-aged men.

### Core task
Browse for a song and attempt to play a song using the music sheets and varied methods of reading the sheets.

### Severity ratings
**1** = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project<br>**2** = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority<br>**3** = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority

## Website A: [Musescore](http://musescore.com/)

#### Description
When looking for websites that could be used for music learning and middle-aged men, I found this to be one of the most versatile. It allows users to both find and upload music sheets for original or covered songs, with transcriptions and audios for users to play along. Users can choose to learn music from a selection of classical or pop music and play a variety of instruments. Users can use this in the website format or on their touchscreen device.
#### Overall Evaluation
For the most part, this website seems straightforward with providing music sheets and functionalities to learn how to play an instrument alongside one’s favorite songs. The site can be made much cleaner and useful for middle-aged men by making sure we prioritize the viewing and playing experience of learning how to play an instrument through music sheets.

| Heuristic & Description | Evaluation | Severity Rating |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| **1\. Visibility of system status**<br>The website should communicate what status the user is in | **Good:** When a user presses play, the website can play a guide, highlighted in red, alongside a user’s own playing.<br>**Bad:** It only highlights a measure at a time, so users who are just starting out may not know which note they are on.<br>***Recommendation:** Add an option to highlight individual notes when the audio is played.* | 2 |
| **2\. Match between system and the real world**<br>Concepts, words, and images reflect ones used in the real world | **Good:** There is an option to read the notes through a more visual method. For example, rather than sight-reading the music notes, a user can play with a piano visualizer.<br>**Good:** Additionally, the jargon they use is similar to what they use between musicians, such as “score” and “composition.”<br>**Bad:** If one plays the sheets without the audio play-along, the user has to scroll vertically on the screen to read the next page, unless they are in full screen mode. This is a mis-match between the system and the real world, as people often flip the page horizontally.<br>***Recommendation:** Have an interaction where the page can “flip” horizontally through a click or drag within the normal view of the website.* | 1 |
| **3\. User control and freedom**<br>Users have room to undo actions and mistakes | **Good:** While playing the songs, users can control the tempo using the metronome feature, play and pause the audio play-along, and click to restart the audio play-along from the beginning of the score.<br>**Bad:** There is no button to restart a measure if a user messes up while playing in real life. If they are playing in the middle of a measure, they cannot simply click on the measure to restart the play-along there. Users can only click other measures to start the audio from those respective measures. This poses a problem as the user may just begin learning to sight-read and play more slowly.<br>***Recommendation:** Have buttons to go back and forth between measures.* | 2 |
| **4\. Consistency and standards**<br>Website is designed in a way that's consistent with other commonly used websites | **Good:** Other music learning platforms also display music sheets with metronomes and play-alongs.<br>**Good:** There is a filter menu on the left when browsing music sheets, similar to how other websites display search results.<br>**Bad:** Other music learning platforms have their music sheets displayed front and center, while Musescore places it on the left. The right of the screen displays the score information (title, composer, duration, etc.) and comments from other users. It is a more social platform in this sense.<br>**Bad:** When browsing the sheets, they place their recommended classes at the top. Users are required to scroll down to see the free music sheets.<br>***Recommendation:** Center the music sheets on the screen.*<br>***Recommendation:** Put the recommended courses in another page so that users who want to find music sheets can direct their focus on that.* | 3 |
| **5\. Error prevention**<br>Prevent actions users do not want to follow through with | **Good:** Musescore leaves little room for error on their website and does not require much input from the user. Pop-ups appear when a user cannot complete an action they don’t have the app for.<br>**Bad:** For users new to playing instruments, they may not know what the metronome or transpose features are for. They might accidentally click it thinking it is necessary for playing.<br>***Recommendation:** Have a quick onboarding process for new users.* | 2 |
| **6\. Recognition rather than recall**<br>Interfaces should be easily accessible to support recognition | **Good:** All the functionalities related to playing the music are visible above the sheets.<br>**Bad:** When playing, it is difficult to see which page a user is on. A user would either need to scroll within the sheets and count all the pages themselves or scroll to the description box to see the music sheet details.<br>***Recommendation:** Have a page number at the top of each music sheet.* | 2 |
| **7\. Flexibility and efficiency of use**<br>Allow users to tailor their experience through shortcuts and customization | **Bad:** A user cannot customize how they view their music sheets besides viewing it as a full screen or not.<br>**Bad:** Since scrolling is the only way to move to the next page, a user cannot mimic the functionality like they would for flipping music pages. Scrolling takes additional time to correctly position a music page so that a user can view the entire sheet at once.<br>***Recommendation:** Add a quick shortcut click or tap feature to “flip” to the next page. When navigating between pages, have the music sheets occupy a fixed space on the screen to remove the need to adjust when scrolling.*<br>***Recommendation:** Allow users to view their music sheets in different dimensions and different numbers of measures at a time.* | 2 |
| **8\. Aesthetic and minimalist design**<br>Website should be simple and contain only necessary information | **Good:** When browsing, the sheet music acts as a thumbnail, allowing the user to quickly glance at what the difficulty of playing might be.<br>**Good:** With the music sheet dominating the screen space, there is not much information from first glance that is irrelevant. White, light gray, blue, and red are the only colors used in the interface, and use of colors are minimal.<br>**Bad:** When browsing for sheets, all the sheet details are displayed, including the number of pages, timestamp, and sheet description written by the user. This creates a cluttered effect.<br>**Bad:** A lot of the content includes hyperlinks to other scores, which include long titles. Other content also can be distracting as a user scrolls, such as comments, the comment box, and ratings of the score. The notes itself can be overwhelming for beginning music learners, so it would be best to reduce the cognitive load of the user visually.<br>**Bad:** Ads appear throughout the site and their sale banners take up a fixed portion of the screen throughout the site, unless it is removed.<br>***Recommendation:** Move score/uploader information below the music sheet, and find a cleaner way to display links and other recommended music sheets.* | 3 |
| **9\. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**<br>Display error messages and solutions to help a user recover from mistakes | **Good:** If a user is on a free trial or using the website app, a message will appear that shows they need a Musescore Pro membership or download the mobile app to use the feature.<br>**Bad:** The messages and modals that appear prompting a user to purchase Musescore Pro or download the app are all different in color and size.<br>***Recommendation:** Messages can visually be standardized to be consistent and recognizable across all inaccessible features.* | 1 |
| **10\. Help and documentation**<br> Present easily accessible and searchable help with steps to solve a problem | **Good:** Musescore offers a help center with FAQs and descriptions to find sheet music.<br>**Bad:** There is no live help feature, which may be useful for middle-aged men troubleshooting within the platform.<br>***Recommendation:** Have a live chat feature, possibly with a chatbot, that can help guide a user to learn how to use the website.* | 2 |

## Website B: [SmartMusic](https://www.smartmusic.com/)

#### Description
SmartMusic is a more immersive music learning platform that connects students with teachers through the cloud. Their app allows users to select from a large database of music sheets - some of which include play-alongs. 

#### Overall Evaluation
When looking at the website initially, there seems to be an overwhelming amount of features and information. The features are not displayed aesthetically visually and could be made simpler.

| Heuristic & Description | Evaluation | Severity Rating |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| **1\. Visibility of system status**<br>The website should communicate what status the user is in | **Good:** When a user presses play, each measure is highlighted in blue. A vertical line shows exactly which note the song is at.<br>**Good:** When recording, the system shows which notes the user has played correctly or missed with green and red notes.<br>**Good:** It displays which page the user is on.<br>**Good:** When browsing for sheets, difficulty levels are displayed. | 1 |
| **2\. Match between system and the real world**<br>Concepts, words, and images reflect ones used in the real world | **Good:** The terms the website uses matches those used by musicians, such as “score” and “takes."<br>**Bad:** Navigating through music sheets requires vertical scrolling, rather than horizontal. This does not reflect real-world flipping of pages.<br>***Recommendation:** Have arrows to navigate between pages horizontally.* | 2 |
| **3\. User control and freedom**<br>Users have room to undo actions and mistakes | **Good:** The user can control the pace the music is playing at with the metronome, add accompaniment, and record their playing on their own.<br>**Good:** The user can choose which instrument and song they would like to play. | 1 |
| **4\. Consistency and standards**<br>Website is designed in a way that's consistent with other commonly used websites | **Good:** Music sheets are displayed front and center, allowing the user to focus on it while playing.<br>**Bad:** When viewing the website on a browser, it does not allow a user to minimize the window to a smaller size. The screen must be viewed with larger dimensions.<br>***Recommendation:** Create a responsive design for browsing music sheets.* | 2 |
| **5\. Error prevention**<br>Prevent actions users do not want to follow through with | **Good:** For music sheets, the “Open” button is grayed and unclickable, with a message saying a subscription is needed to access the music.<br>**Bad:** It is difficult to tell whether the metronome scale is used to adjust volume or tempo. It is also unclear what the subdivisions checkbox next to the metronome feature does without clicking it.<br>**Bad:** Icons at the top are small and next by the “Practice” button, potentially causing mistapping errors.<br>***Recommendation:** Have an onboarding process explaining each feature of the website, and have a numerical indicator for the metronome tempo.*<br>***Recommendation:** Make icons larger, and position the “Practice” button farther away from the help icon.* | 3 |
| **6\. Recognition rather than recall**<br>Interfaces should be easily accessible to support recognition | **Bad:** Some icons and tab names like “Loop” and “Display” are not intuitive to a music learning experience. A user may need to click within the icons and pages to remember what each corresponds to.<br>***Recommendation:** Rename tabs, and choose icons that better correspond with the content.* | 2 |
| **7\. Flexibility and efficiency of use**<br>Allow users to tailor their experience through shortcuts and customization | **Bad:** There is only one mode of viewing. A user is unable to full screen the sheets without any additional UI, and the music notes cannot be displayed as larger. This may be frustrating for people who prefer larger elements to read more easily.<br>***Recommendation:** Add multiple views for the music sheets so users can customize how they want to read the notes.* | 2 |
| **8\. Aesthetic and minimalist design**<br>Website should be simple and contain only necessary information | **Bad:** The padding around text is not large enough, making the contents look squished.<br>**Bad:** Sheet music and books are displayed in a list format, making it difficult and overwhelming to read visually. Book covers, rather than sheet music previews, are shown.<br>***Recommendation:** Display sheet music and books in a grid/card format, and remove unnecessary details, such as publisher or the print icon, from these thumbnail cards.* | 3 |
| **9\. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**<br>Display error messages and solutions to help a user recover from mistakes | **Good:** The help button has a fixed position across all parts of the app.<br>**Bad:** The help icon is small and difficult to notice.<br>***Recommendation:** Resize the help icon and place it at the bottom right corner of the screen.* | 1 |
| **10\. Help and documentation**<br> Present easily accessible and searchable help with steps to solve a problem | **Good:** There is a help center that is searchable and categorized by content, as well as a quick search.<br>
Bad: Within each help module, the website navigates to a page with bulleted hyperlinks, making it hard to visualize what problem each article will solve.
Recommendation: Remove the additional page including the bulleted list of articles, and display hyperlinked article titles within a dropdown in the current help module.
