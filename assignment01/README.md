# **Making Music Learning Accessible**
## Assignment 01 - Heuristic Analysis
Chantal Tan, DH 110

**About the project**
Learning how to play a new instrument at an older age can be daunting and challenging. From learning how to sight-read, finding music sheets that are appropriate to play, and practicing alone, there are some key aspects a music learning platform must provide to create a smooth, accessible learning experience. I hope to explore how the process of browsing songs and practicing with music sheets online can be made more seamless for the target audience of middle-aged men.

## Heuristic Analysis
### Core task
Browse for a song and attempt to play a song using the music sheets and varied methods of reading the sheets.

### Severity ratings
**1** = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project
**2** = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority
**3** = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority
