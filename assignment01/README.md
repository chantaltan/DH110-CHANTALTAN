# **Making Music Learning Accessible**
## Assignment 01 - Heuristic Analysis
Chantal Tan, DH 110

### About the project
Learning how to play a new instrument at an older age can be daunting and challenging. From learning how to sight-read, finding music sheets that are appropriate to play, and practicing alone, there are some key aspects a music learning platform must provide to create a smooth, accessible learning experience. I hope to explore how the process of browsing songs and practicing with music sheets online can be made more seamless for the target audience of middle-aged men.

### Core task
Browse for a song and attempt to play a song using the music sheets and varied methods of reading the sheets.

### Severity ratings
**1** = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project
**2** = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority
**3** = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority

## Website A: [Musescore](http://musescore.com/)

#### Description
When looking for websites that could be used for music learning and middle-aged men, I found this to be one of the most versatile. It allows users to both find and upload music sheets for original or covered songs, with transcriptions and audios for users to play along. Users can choose to learn music from a selection of classical or pop music and play a variety of instruments. Users can use this in the website format or on their touchscreen device.
#### Overall Evaluation
For the most part, this website seems straightforward with providing music sheets and functionalities to learn how to play an instrument alongside one’s favorite songs. The site can be made much cleaner and useful for middle-aged men by making sure we prioritize the viewing and playing experience of learning how to play an instrument through music sheets.

| Heuristic & Description | Evaluation | Severity Rating |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| **1\. Visibility of system status**<br>The website should communicate what status the user is in | **Good:** When a user presses play, the website can play a guide, highlighted in red, alongside a user’s own playing.<br>**Bad:** It only highlights a measure at a time, so users who are just starting out may not know which note they are on.<br>***Recommendation:** Add an option to highlight individual notes when the audio is played.* | 2 |
| **2\. Match between system and the real world**<br>Concepts, words, and images reflect ones used in the real world | **Good:** There is an option to read the notes through a more visual method. For example, rather than sight-reading the music notes, a user can play with a piano visualizer.<br>**Good:** Additionally, the jargon they use is similar to what they use between musicians, such as “score” and “composition.”<br>**Bad:** If one plays the sheets without the audio play-along, the user has to scroll vertically on the screen to read the next page, unless they are in full screen mode. This is a mis-match between the system and the real world, as people often flip the page horizontally.<br>***Recommendation:** Have an interaction where the page can “flip” horizontally through a click or drag within the normal view of the website.* | 1 |
| **3\. User control and freedom**<br>Users have room to undo actions and mistakes | **Good:** While playing the songs, users can control the tempo using the metronome feature, play and pause the audio play-along, and click to restart the audio play-along from the beginning of the score.<br>**Bad:** There is no button to restart a measure if a user messes up while playing in real life. If they are playing in the middle of a measure, they cannot simply click on the measure to restart the play-along there. Users can only click other measures to start the audio from those respective measures. This poses a problem as the user may just begin learning to sight-read and play more slowly.<br>***Recommendation:** Have buttons to go back and forth between measures.* | 2 |
| **4\. Consistency and standards**<br>Website is designed in a way that's consistent with other commonly used websites | **Good:** Other music learning platforms also display music sheets with metronomes and play-alongs.<br>**Good:** There is a filter menu on the left when browsing music sheets, similar to how other websites display search results.<br>**Bad:** Other music learning platforms have their music sheets displayed front and center, while Musescore places it on the left. The right of the screen displays the score information (title, composer, duration, etc.) and comments from other users. It is a more social platform in this sense.<br>**Bad:** When browsing the sheets, they place their recommended classes at the top. Users are required to scroll down to see the free music sheets.<br>***Recommendation:** Center the music sheets on the screen.*<br>***Recommendation:** Put the recommended courses in another page so that users who want to find music sheets can direct their focus on that.* | 3 |
| **5\. Error prevention**<br>Prevent actions users do not want to follow through with | **Good:** Musescore leaves little room for error on their website and does not require much input from the user. Pop-ups appear when a user cannot complete an action they don’t have the app for.<br>**Bad:** For users new to playing instruments, they may not know what the metronome or transpose features are for. They might accidentally click it thinking it is necessary for playing.<br>***Recommendation:** Have a quick onboarding process for new users.* | 2 |
| **6\. Recognition rather than recall**<br>Interfaces should be easily accessible to support recognition | **Good:** All the functionalities related to playing the music are visible above the sheets.<br>**Bad:** When playing, it is difficult to see which page a user is on. A user would either need to scroll within the sheets and count all the pages themselves or scroll to the description box to see the music sheet details.<br>***Recommendation:** Have a page number at the top of each music sheet.* | 2 |
| **7\. Flexibility and efficiency of use**<br>Allow users to tailor their experience through shortcuts and customization | **Bad:** A user cannot customize how they view their music sheets besides viewing it as a full screen or not.<br>**Bad:** Since scrolling is the only way to move to the next page, a user cannot mimic the functionality like they would for flipping music pages. Scrolling takes additional time to correctly position a music page so that a user can view the entire sheet at once.<br>***Recommendation:** Add a quick shortcut click or tap feature to “flip” to the next page. When navigating between pages, have the music sheets occupy a fixed space on the screen to remove the need to adjust when scrolling.*<br>
>***Recommendation:** Allow users to view their music sheets in different dimensions and different numbers of measures at a time.* | 2 |
