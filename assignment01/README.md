# **Making Music Learning Accessible**
## Assignment 01 - Heuristic Analysis
Chantal Tan, DH 110

### About the project
Learning how to play a new instrument at an older age can be daunting and challenging. From learning how to sight-read, finding music sheets that are appropriate to play, and practicing alone, there are some key aspects a music learning platform must provide to create a smooth, accessible learning experience. I hope to explore how the process of browsing songs and practicing with music sheets online can be made more seamless for the target audience of middle-aged men.

### Core task
Browse for a song and attempt to play a song using the music sheets and varied methods of reading the sheets.

### Severity ratings
**1** = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project
**2** = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority
**3** = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority

## Website A: [Musescore](http://musescore.com/)

#### Description
When looking for websites that could be used for music learning and middle-aged men, I found this to be one of the most versatile. It allows users to both find and upload music sheets for original or covered songs, with transcriptions and audios for users to play along. Users can choose to learn music from a selection of classical or pop music and play a variety of instruments. Users can use this in the website format or on their touchscreen device.
#### Overall Evaluation
For the most part, this website seems straightforward with providing music sheets and functionalities to learn how to play an instrument alongside one’s favorite songs. The site can be made much cleaner and useful for middle-aged men by making sure we prioritize the viewing and playing experience of learning how to play an instrument through music sheets.

| Heuristic & Description | Evaluation | Severity Rating |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| **1\. Visibility of system status**<br>The website should communicate what status the user is in | **Good:** When a user presses play, the website can play a guide, highlighted in red, alongside a user’s own playing.<br>**Bad:** It only highlights a measure at a time, so users who are just starting out may not know which note they are on.<br>*Recommendation: Add an option to highlight individual notes when the audio is played.* | 2 |
