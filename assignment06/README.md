# **Making Music Learning Accessible**
## Assignment 06 - Interface Design
Chantal Tan | DH 110

## Introduction
The purpose of my project is to make music learning a smooth, accessible learning experience for middle-aged men. I am doing this through the redesign of the Musescore website. Through music sheet learning and courses, users can create their own music learning experience online. 

The purpose of adding interface design is to progress the low fidelity designs into a more stylized version. By using Figma, I can create style components to reuse across all web screens for streamlined designing. Good interface design allows the user to have a more intuitive experience by choosing appropriate fonts, accessible colors, and prioritizing the view of necessary information. Determining the design system allows for all screens to be standardized across the app.

The Figma document for the digitized wireflow can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/C4mhVS68SXBz0grFeql6tK/DH-110-Project?node-id=45%3A2).
