# **Making Music Learning Accessible**
## Assignment 06 - Interface Design
Chantal Tan | DH 110

## Introduction
The purpose of my project is to make music learning a smooth, accessible learning experience for middle-aged men. I am doing this through the redesign of the Musescore website. Through music sheet learning and courses, users can create their own music learning experience online. 

The purpose of adding interface design is to progress the low fidelity designs into a more stylized version. By using Figma, I can create style components to reuse across all web screens for streamlined designing. Good interface design allows the user to have a more intuitive experience by choosing appropriate fonts, accessible colors, and prioritizing the view of necessary information. Determining the design system allows for all screens to be standardized across the app.

The Figma document for the digitized wireflow, initial screen designs, and design system can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/C4mhVS68SXBz0grFeql6tK/DH-110-Project?node-id=45%3A2).

## Screen Designs
### Chosen Screen
I chose the Browse Music page to test variations in GUI.

### Typographic Variations
**Using both Lexend and Inter fonts**

**Using only Inter font**

</p> 

**Using smaller font sizes for the filters**

### Shape Variations
**Box shaped rectangle elements**

**Rounded rectangle elements**

**Larger rounded elements + cards with drop shadow**

### Color Variations
**Light Mode - Light Blue**

**Light Mode - Light Yellow**

**Dark Mode**

## Impression Test
I then conducted an impression test to see which look-and-feel of my GUI components best fit the website. The recording of the impression test can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12fkI9iLRKtb1rkD_6uLretcp8OYfdWLb/view?usp=sharing).


### Summary of Findings
In the 5-second impression test, the participant mainly made comments about the color and sizing of the components. 

**Overall Impression**
> Upon first glance, he could tell that the website was related to music and immediately recognized the blue color in the navigation bar. 

**Typography**
> The user preferred the screen that had two fonts (Lexend and Inter) rather than just one font (Inter). He also preferred the screen with a smaller font for the filters.

**Shape**
> The user did not notice a large difference between the straight versus rounded corners, but did prefer having a larger card with a drop shadow for each music sheet for easier viewing.

**Color**
> The user preferred the blue colors and thought the yellow version was "weird." He did not have a preference between light and dark mode but still noted that the dark mode "looks unordinary."

## Final Design System
Here is how the final design system looked in Figma:

The documentation for font, color, and component specifications are outlined below.

### Color Contrast Check
I used the Stark Contrast Check to see if my designs passed the recommended 4.5:1 accessibility check.
