# **Making Music Learning Accessible**
## Assignment 07 - High Fidelity Prototypes
Chantal Tan | DH 110

## Project Description

### Summary
This interactive prototype is a redesign of the Musescore website and hopes to create an easy and fulfilling music learning experience for the target users of middle-aged men. It hopes to simplify the information needed to find an appropriate music sheet and paid courses.

### Process
I used Figma to create my low-fidelity prototypes (making my low-fidelity sketches into a digital format) and high-fidelity prototypes. I also created my design system while creating my first iteration of high-fidelity prototypes and continued to adjust it as I iterated. After conducting two cognitive walkthroughs with my first high-fidelity prototype, I iterated on it to create the second version.

### Purpose
The purpose of this interactive prototype is to test how easy it is to navigate and complete the key tasks on the website, validate the flows, and see what can be further improved on.

### Tasks
This prototype supports 3 tasks:
1. Browse music sheets by filtering to find an appropriate score to play
2. Find a music course to purchase
3. See saved sheets, purchased courses, and upload music sheets

## Final Wireflow
Displayed below are the final wireflows for each task. You can also find the full wireflow [here](https://www.figma.com/file/C4mhVS68SXBz0grFeql6tK/DH-110-Project?node-id=122%3A2807).

## Prototype 1
Access the first prototype [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/C4mhVS68SXBz0grFeql6tK/DH-110-Project?node-id=122%3A2808&scaling=scale-down-width&page-id=199%3A8576&starting-point-node-id=131%3A5205&show-proto-sidebar=1).

This first version of the high-fidelity prototype closely resembled the low-fidelity wireframes I made on Figma. It mainly had the design system implemented, but there weren't as many cosmetic changes, and I tested this in two cognitive walkthrough sessions.

## In-class Cognitive Walkthrough
In the in-class cognitive walkthrough sessions, users were able to walk through the first two task flows. There was a heavier emphasis on the finding and playing music sheets task (Task 1). Both participants could clearly enter and exit the tasks, and most of the feedback I received indicated my prototype was **intuitive**, **clear**, and **easy-to-use**. 

One user noted that they liked that progress could be saved through the bookmark function, but it was unclear whether the searching progress was saved. He suggested a "Reset All" or "Clear All" button for the filters, and he also wanted to go back to the browsing page filled with their selected filters once they had finished playing a song.

It was also clear that the courses were a paid feature of the site, and the main purpose of the site was to find and learn from music sheets.

## Prototype 2
Access the prototype with the 2nd iteration [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/C4mhVS68SXBz0grFeql6tK/DH-110-Project?node-id=163%3A3583&scaling=scale-down-width&page-id=199%3A8576&starting-point-node-id=131%3A5205&show-proto-sidebar=1).

After the cognitive walkthroughs and based on the professor's feedback, I decide to iterate on the participants' feedback as well as make some cosmetic changes on my own. 

### General Changes
1. **Cleaner and Simpler Filters:** Because the music sheet cards already have some information, and the thumbnails with notes can be visually stimulating, I decided to make the filter menu simpler. When the categories are expanded, instead of displaying all of the possible options to filter by for intstrument or genre, users can add the appropriate ones for their needs by clicking the "+" button. This accounts for the multitude of instruments and genres that would take longer to scroll through and find. 
2. **Prioritizing Music Sheets:** In my first prototype, the music sheets would be viewed under the music sheet details (title, number of pages, etc.). The sheet details were also mixed in with the play settings (i.e. setting the bpm). In the second iteration, I reorganized the screen so that the music sheets would display first, and the music sheet details would be at the bottom and separated from the play settings. I also added more functionality to the sheets in the prototype (full-screen view of the sheets, printing, downloading, comments). 
3. **Cleaning Up:** I cleaned up the navigation bar and made a footer to create a more professional look to site. I also added some color to the hero image on the home page and made sure all the font styles in the design system were being used across the site.
