# **Making Music Learning Accessible**
## Assignment 07 - High Fidelity Prototypes
Chantal Tan | DH 110

## Project Description

### Summary
This interactive prototype is a redesign of the Musescore website and hopes to create an easy and fulfilling music learning experience for the target users of middle-aged men. It hopes to simplify the information needed to find an appropriate music sheet and paid courses.

### Process
I used Figma to create my low-fidelity prototypes (making my low-fidelity sketches into a digital format) and high-fidelity prototypes. I also created my design system while creating my first iteration of high-fidelity prototypes and continued to adjust it as I iterated. After conducting two cognitive walkthroughs with my first high-fidelity prototype, I iterated on it to create the second version.

### Purpose
The purpose of this interactive prototype is to test how easy it is to navigate and complete the key tasks on the website, validate the flows, and see what can be further improved on.

### Tasks
This prototype supports 3 tasks:
1. Browse music sheets by filtering to find an appropriate score to play
2. Find a course to purchase
3. See saved sheets, purchased courses, and upload music sheets

## Final Wireflow
Here are the final wireflows for each task.
