# **Making Music Learning Accessible**
## Assignment 05 - Low Fidelity Prototypes
Chantal Tan | DH 110

### Overview
#### Purpose
The purpose of low fidelity prototyping is to use the insights gained from user research to design preliminary screens. It is quick to sketch and lay out on paper or wireframing platforms, and we can tackle how features should be included early on.

#### User Research
Based on my user research, I found that users wanted the simplest learning experience possible that reflected the real world. Additionally, I learned that I must design for middle-aged men who come from a range of music experience â€“ such as those who learned before and want to learn again or those who are learning from scratch. Thus, I focus on these research questions:
- How might I design an accessible learning experience for middle-aged men *with no prior experience* playing an instrument?
- How might I design an accessible learning experience for middle-aged men *with prior experience* playing an instrument?

#### Personas
From the user research, I created two personas reflecting the experiences pointed out in the research questions:
- A man with some prior experience playing an instrument but would like an easy and relaxing way to re-learn classical songs. He is willing to pay extra for more guided learning.
- A parent with no prior experience playing an instrument but would like to learn simple pop songs for his kids

#### Features
The tasks I will design will include the following:
1. Find music sheets by filtering
2. Play the music sheets
3. Find courses to learn instruments and how to sight-read
