## Making Music Learning Accessible
## Chantal Tan
### About the project
Learning how to play a new instrument at an older age can be daunting and challenging. From learning how to sight-read, finding music sheets that are appropriate to play, and practicing alone, there are some key aspects a music learning platform must provide to create a smooth, accessible learning experience. I hope to explore how the process of browsing songs and practicing with music sheets online can be made more seamless for the target audience of middle-aged men.
